## 1.0 Velocity and Agenda Builder

### Summary

### 1. Executive Summary

Progress is strong, with both parties aligned on the need for practical, data-driven approaches to AI workforce integration and higher education partnerships. The team is collaborative and open, with a clear sense of mutual respect and willingness to iterate on ideas. The most critical milestone is building a functional prototype of an AI-powered partner-matching tool, contingent on receiving relevant partner data from Ascend.

### 2. Discussion Narrative & Decision Log

#### **AI Workforce Integration & Higher Ed Collaboration**

* **Initial Context:**
  Adam Pryor and Brad Rhorer met to align on a joint session for Indiana colleges/universities, focusing on AI workforce readiness and industry-academic partnerships. Both noted confusion in the field: industry is not as advanced in AI adoption as many assume, and higher ed is struggling to translate AI literacy into workforce value.
* **Options & Perspectives:**
  * Adam suggested a session format that demystifies industry’s AI progress, reassures educators, and pushes for actionable professional development and partnership models.
  * Brad provided context on Indiana’s fragmented workforce/education system, the need for systems alignment, and the reality that most manufacturers are not yet investing heavily in AI.
  * Both agreed that AI skills must be integrated across disciplines, not siloed, and that discernment (not just literacy) is the key workforce skill.
  * Adam proposed building a simple AI tool to match colleges with potential industry partners, using Ascend’s data, as a live demonstration of the kind of skills graduates should have.
* **Final Decision & Rationale:**
  The team will co-design a session that (1) sets realistic expectations about industry’s AI adoption, (2) encourages colleges to focus on AI discernment and cross-disciplinary integration, and (3) provides a hands-on demonstration of AI’s practical use via a partner-matching tool. This approach was chosen to bridge the gap between abstract AI policy and real-world application, and to model the kind of agile, iterative problem-solving expected in the workforce.

#### **Case Study & Tool Development**

* **Initial Context:**
  Adam volunteered to draft several case studies and build a prototype AI tool for the session, contingent on receiving partner data from Brad/Ascend.
* **Options & Perspectives:**
  * Adam will overproduce (4-5 case studies) for Brad to review and select the most contextually relevant.
  * Brad agreed to provide a spreadsheet or similar data set of industry partners, with addresses if possible, and to coordinate via Maria.
* **Final Decision & Rationale:**
  Adam will proceed with tool and case study development, with Brad supplying data and feedback. This iterative, collaborative approach ensures the session is both practical and tailored to Indiana’s context.

### 3. Key Takeaways (The Highlights)

* Industry is not as advanced in AI adoption as higher ed assumes; both sectors are navigating similar uncertainties.
* The session will focus on AI discernment and integration across disciplines, not just AI literacy or isolated technical skills.
* A live demonstration of an AI-powered partner-matching tool will anchor the session, contingent on timely data delivery from Ascend.

**RED:** No blockers identified, but the tool build is contingent on receiving partner data from Ascend.

### 4. Next Steps (Action Items)

[ ]  **Brad Rhorer** : Compile and send a spreadsheet of industry partners (with addresses if possible) to Adam via Maria. [Suggested Deadline: February 20, 2026]
[ ]  **Adam Pryor** : Draft 4-5 case studies and begin building the AI partner-matching tool. [Suggested Deadline: February 23, 2026]
[ ]  **Adam Pryor** : Share tool prototype and case studies with Brad and Maria for review/feedback. [Suggested Deadline: February 25, 2026]
[ ]  **Brad Rhorer** : Review case studies/tool and provide contextual feedback. [Suggested Deadline: February 27, 2026]

### 5. Other Topics (Status Tags)

* **K12 Digital Literacy Integration** YELLOW (Parked/At Risk)
  * **Reason:** Recognized as a parallel issue, but not the focus of this session. Risk is that K12 is also behind on AI integration, which may impact future workforce pipelines.
* **Lilly Foundation Grant Alignment** GREEN (Completed/Update)
  * **Status:** Both parties are aware of the Lilly Foundation’s role in incentivizing AI initiatives at Indiana colleges; this context is informing session design.

### 🗓️ Proposed Agenda for Next Meeting

**Target Date/Time:** TBD (suggest week of February 24, 2026)
**Primary Goal:** Finalize session structure, review AI tool prototype, and select case studies for use.

#### 1. Priority Discussion Items (The Rule of 3)

1. **Review of AI Partner-Matching Tool Prototype**
   * **Lead:** Adam Pryor
   * **Context:** Ensure the tool is functional and contextually relevant for the session.
   * **Dependency:** Requires Brad to send partner data first.
2. **Selection and Refinement of Case Studies**
   * **Lead:** Brad Rhorer
   * **Context:** Choose the most relevant case studies for Indiana’s context.
   * **Dependency:** Requires Adam to draft and share case studies.
3. **Session Slide/Content Integration**
   * **Lead:** Adam Pryor
   * **Context:** Integrate Brad’s slides and finalize session flow.
   * **Dependency:** Requires both parties to review and agree on content.

#### 2. The Parking Lot (Overflow)

* **K12 AI Integration** : Not in scope for this session; Brad/Adam to monitor for future relevance.
* **Lilly Foundation Grant Reporting** : No immediate action; context only.
