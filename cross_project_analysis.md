# Cross-Project Synthesis: Framework Integration for Lilly Foundation Convening

**Purpose:** To synthesize the core narrative elements from previous presentations (AAUA Keynote, Presidents' Institute Panel, and Goodwill Workforce Prompt) into a unified strategic foundation for the Lilly Foundation convening ("Preparing Students for the Workforce, AI and Collaboration").

## 1. The Core Narrative Arc

The Lilly session must weave together three distinct threads from our previous work:

- **The Existential Context (From AAUA):** Higher education is facing a "Perfect Storm" (Resistance, Model Ending, Fading Credentials) and a "Student Paradox" (near-total AI adoption paired with profound anxiety/disorientation).
- **The Strategic Shift (From PI Panel):** We must move institutions from a defensive posture ("AI-proofing") to a proactive one ("AI-leading"). This requires escaping the "Gravity of the Boring" and leveraging the Seven-Step Strategic Framework to build capacity.
- **The Pragmatic Application (From Goodwill):** To make this tangible for the workforce, we must adopt a tiered model of AI implementation (Operational/Prompt Level, Workflow Automation, Systems).

## 2. Key Frameworks to Deploy

### A. The "Curatorial Turn" & New Roles (AAUA)

The transition from "sage on the stage" to "architect of discovery." For higher-ed leaders at the Lilly convening, emphasize how their faculty and staff must evolve into new roles to support workforce readiness:
- **Protocol Designers:** Faculty creating generative assignments (e.g., the "Un-cheatable Capstone") rather than static tests.
- **Generative System Architects:** Instructional designers building the workflows that teach "Systemic Thinking."
- **Disorientation Navigators:** Student success teams guiding students through the "Iceberg of Anxiety" and helping them find human meaning amidst automation.

### B. The Seven-Step Strategic Framework (PI Panel & AAUA)

A roadmap for institutional maturity. For this session, focus heavily on the first four steps as they most directly impact immediate student/workforce outcomes:

1. **Automating Processes:** The immediate ROI.
2. **Personalizing Processes:** Tailored student support.
3. **Data-Driven Decision Making:** The "Insight Engine" (Critical for Ascend Indiana data integration).
4. **Strategic Re-imagination:** The Pivot—Focusing on "Renewable Assignments" and Specifications Grading to eliminate the incentive to cheat and build real-world portfolios.

### C. The Productivity Tax & Human-in-the-Loop (Goodwill/Lilly Background)

Synthesize the "Global State of AI" report with the Goodwill workforce focus.
- **The Problem:** The corporate "Productivity Tax" occurs when AI is layered onto broken workflows without structural redesign.
- **The Solution for Students:** Move beyond basic "AI Literacy" to "AI Discernment." Teach Evaluative Judgment, Systemic Thinking, and the "Editor's Art" (as outlined in the Undermind prompt).

## 3. The Lilly Session Strategy (The "Through-Line")

To successfully integrate these past resources into the February 13th session with Brad Rhorer, Adam should employ this specific narrative flow:

1. **The Hook (The Gap):** Start with the "Student Paradox" (from AAUA) paired with the "Productivity Tax" (from the Global State of AI). Show that students are anxious and employers are frustrated because we are teaching prompt engineering instead of structural AI reasoning.
2. **The Evidence (Ascend Data):** Transition to Brad's Ascend Indiana data to ground the global gap in local, Indiana-specific realities.
3. **The Application (Case Studies):** Use the newly drafted Indiana-specific case studies (ag-tech, logistics, advanced manufacturing) to demonstrate what the "Curatorial Turn" actually looks like in practice. Show how these assignments build the "Editor's Art."
4. **The Call to Action (The AI-Ready Campus):** End with an abridged version of the "Building the AI-Ready Campus" imperative. Challenge the attending Presidents and Provosts to become "Sandbox Keepers" who clear the way for this essential pedagogical transformation.
