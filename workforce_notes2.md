## 1.0 Velocity and Agenda Builder

### Summary

### 1. Executive Summary

The team is moving quickly to respond to a sudden, large-scale funding opportunity for AI initiatives in Indiana, with strong alignment around leveraging practical, workforce-oriented AI solutions and partnerships. There is high energy and mutual respect, but also concern about institutional bandwidth, leadership turnover, and the risk of missed opportunities due to resource constraints. The most critical milestone is developing actionable, context-sensitive case studies and frameworks that can be rapidly deployed to help colleges articulate and implement effective AI/workforce strategies before the May 1st funding request deadline.

### 2. Discussion Narrative & Decision Log

#### **Lilly Foundation AI Initiative for Indiana Schools**

* **Initial Context:**
  Adam Pryor was unexpectedly brought into a major initiative where the Lilly Foundation is distributing $500M to Indiana schools for AI projects, with minimal prescriptive guidance. The foundation is convening 30 schools for a rapid, two-day working conference to ideate both internal and collaborative projects. CIC (Council of Independent Colleges) was invited to help lead programming, with Adam focusing on higher education and workforce intersections.
* **Options & Perspectives:** Adam initially assumed industry partners would drive the workforce side, but found their AI/workforce expertise lacking. He identified a need for practical frameworks and case studies to help colleges understand and plan for AI integration, referencing Krystal Rawls’ work as a model. Krystal offered her expertise in workforce development, AI training, and case study design, emphasizing a three-level approach: (1) prompt-level operational AI, (2) workflow automation, and (3) agentic operations (not recommended for higher ed yet due to security concerns). Both agreed on the importance of practical, low-lift, high-ROI solutions and the need for discernment skills over mere AI literacy.
* **Final Decision & Rationale:** The group decided to focus on developing and sharing actionable case studies and frameworks, with Krystal providing her materials and Adam tailoring them for the Indiana context. The rationale is to equip colleges—especially those with low AI sophistication—with concrete, discussion-ready examples that can drive both internal and cross-institutional planning, while avoiding overreliance on vendor solutions or risky automation.

#### **Workforce Development & AI Integration Models**

* **Initial Context:**
  Krystal described her grant-funded model for embedding students in local workforce ecosystems, using labor market data (e.g., Lightcast), student choice, and community partnerships to close the digital divide and provide real-world experience. She highlighted the lack of work colleges on the West Coast and her efforts to launch a Civic Institute/work college model.
* **Options & Perspectives:** The team discussed the trade-offs between technical upskilling (e.g., code literacy) and focusing on durable, transferable skills (analytics, project management, marketing). Krystal advocated for minimal technical requirements for faculty, embedding small, scalable technical modules (e.g., 8-hour LinkedIn Learning pathways) into curricula, and prioritizing student empowerment and choice in workforce placements. Adam noted the potential to adapt this model for both urban and rural colleges, with different resource needs (e.g., housing vs. digital infrastructure).
* **Final Decision & Rationale:** The consensus was to prioritize models that are student-centered, scalable, and adaptable to local needs, leveraging existing community and industry partnerships. The rationale is to maximize impact with limited resources, ensure student agency, and avoid commodification of AI education.

#### **Barriers to Implementation & Funding**

* **Initial Context:**
  Krystal shared challenges in securing executive sponsorship and funding for her work college model, despite demonstrated success and alignment with institutional missions. Leadership turnover and resource constraints at CSU and other institutions were cited as major barriers.
* **Options & Perspectives:** Adam suggested the possibility of integrating the model as a specialized college or workforce lab within existing structures, and discussed the need to align with accreditation requirements. Both acknowledged the difficulty of launching new programs in the current funding climate.
* **Final Decision & Rationale:** No immediate solution was reached, but both agreed to continue exploring funding and partnership opportunities, with Adam offering to help with backend analytics and grant writing as needed. The rationale is to keep momentum and be ready to act if/when funding or leadership support materializes.

### 3. Key Takeaways (The Highlights)

* The Lilly Foundation’s $500M AI initiative is moving at high speed, with a critical need for practical, context-sensitive frameworks and case studies to guide Indiana colleges.
* There is strong alignment around student-centered, workforce-embedded AI models that prioritize discernment, durable skills, and local partnerships over technical complexity or vendor-driven solutions.
* **RED:** Institutional bandwidth and leadership turnover are major blockers to launching new, innovative programs (e.g., work colleges), despite clear models and community need.

### 4. Next Steps (Action Items)

[ ]  **Krystal Rawls** : Send case study worksheet and handout materials to Adam [Suggested Deadline: Feb 20, 2026]
[ ]  **Adam Pryor** : Review Krystal’s materials and adapt for Indiana context; identify 2-3 case studies for the upcoming working conference [Suggested Deadline: Feb 23, 2026]
[ ]  **Adam Pryor** : Follow up with Ascend Indiana and other partners to scope out matching algorithm needs and potential collaboration [Suggested Deadline: Feb 25, 2026]
[ ]  **Adam Pryor** : Reach out to Digital Equity contacts in Chicago/Detroit for potential partnership models relevant to Indiana [Suggested Deadline: Feb 28, 2026]
[ ]  **Krystal Rawls** : Continue seeking executive sponsorship/funding for Civic Institute/work college model; update Adam on any progress [Ongoing]

### 5. Other Topics (Status Tags)

* **Digital Equity Act Funding** RED (Blocker)
  * **Current State:** Loss of federal Digital Equity Act funding has removed a key resource for closing the digital divide, directly impacting AI/workforce initiatives.
  * **Request:** Identify alternative funding streams or partnerships to fill this gap, especially for device/infrastructure needs in rural and underserved areas.
* **Work College Model (Civic Institute)** YELLOW (At Risk)
  * **Reason:** Strong model and demonstrated outcomes, but stalled due to lack of executive sponsorship and institutional bandwidth at CSU.
* **AI Literacy vs. Discernment Skills** GREEN (Completed/Update)
  * **Status:** Team alignment achieved on prioritizing discernment and durable skills over basic AI literacy; approach will inform case study and framework development.

### 🗓️ Proposed Agenda for Next Meeting

**Target Date/Time:** TBD (Suggest week of Feb 24–28, 2026)
**Primary Goal:** Finalize and review case studies/frameworks for Indiana AI initiative; address blockers to implementation and partnership formation.

#### 1. Priority Discussion Items (The Rule of 3)

1. **Case Study/Framework Finalization**
   * **Lead:** Adam Pryor
