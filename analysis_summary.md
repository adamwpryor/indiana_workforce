# Lilly Foundation Convening: Session Analysis

**Chief of Staff Briefing**
Based on the files present in `2026.02_lilly`, here is the strategic breakdown of your upcoming session "Preparing Students for the Workforce, AI and Collaboration" on February 13, 2026.

## 1. What We Have (The Intel)
- **Coordination & Logistics ([workforce_notes3.md](file:///c:/Users/adamw/OneDrive/Desktop/coding_workspaces/repurposing_presentations/2026.02_lilly/workforce_notes3.md)):** You are tagged to deliver a session to a sophisticated audience of higher-ed leaders (incl. 31 presidents) as part of the Lilly Foundation's $500M AI initiative. You are co-presenting with Brad Rhorer (Ascend Indiana). 
- **The Case Study Focus ([workforce_notes2.md](file:///c:/Users/adamw/OneDrive/Desktop/coding_workspaces/repurposing_presentations/2026.02_lilly/workforce_notes2.md)):** You've collaborated with Krystal Rawls to leverage her workplace-embedded AI models. The focus must be *student-centered discernment* over basic literacy, adapting her frameworks away from West Coast tech to Indiana's specific landscape.
- **The "Live Tool" Commit ([workforce_notes.md](file:///c:/Users/adamw/OneDrive/Desktop/coding_workspaces/repurposing_presentations/2026.02_lilly/workforce_notes.md)):** You committed to building a functional prototype of an AI partner-matching tool using Ascend's data to demonstrate actionable AI use.
- **Context:** Several large macro-reports (Global State of AI, New Direction for Students) are included for grounding the narrative.

## 2. Strategic Priorities (The "Rule of 3")
To lead this session effectively, you need to execute on these three critical assets:

1. **The AI Partner-Matching Prototype (High Priority)**
   * **Why:** This is the anchor of your "live demonstration," designed to bridge the gap between abstract policy and practical capability. 
   * **Status:** Blocked pending partner data from Brad Rhorer (Ascend). We must secure this dataset immediately to allow time for the build.
2. **Indiana-Tailored Case Studies (Medium-High Priority)**
   * **Why:** Adapting Krystal Rawls' 3-level approach (Prompt-level, Workflow, avoiding Agentic for now). The audience needs concrete, low-lift, high-ROI examples that make sense for both urban and rural Indiana colleges.
   * **Status:** Needs drafting. 
3. **The Presentation Narrative & Scenario Flow (Medium Priority)**
   * **Why:** Brad wants to avoid "death by PowerPoint" and focus on local context. Your job is to host the main deck, seamlessly transitioning from his data into your scenario-based group activities.
   * **Status:** Pending integration of Brad's specific slides and finalizing the case studies.

## 3. Next Steps (Orchestration)
As your Orchestrator, I recommend delegating immediately to our Swarm:
* Should we trigger the **Engineering Manager** to scaffold the AI partner-matching tool (assuming we can mock the Ascend data for now)? 
* Or should we task the **Content Strategist** with drafting the 2-3 Indiana-specific case studies from Krystal's frameworks?
